# nlp_to_gephi

This repo is a clone of https://github.com/panisson/pygephi_graphstreaming. I have updated the code to Python 3 and added a stanfordnlp and a flask part. Run the code by running the app.py script, and input text for your network in the opened browser window. See the pygephi_graphstreaming library for instructions of what to do in Gephi (very simple).
