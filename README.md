# nlp_to_gephi

This repo is a copy of https://github.com/panisson/pygephi_graphstreaming. I have updated the code to Python 3 and added a stanfordnlp and a flask part. Run the code by running the app.py script, and go to http://localhost:5000/ in your browser to input text for your network. See the pygephi_graphstreaming library for instructions of what to do in Gephi (very simple).
